# HomeworkW1_V3

## Description
My motivation when creating this homework was to complete it within a week and design / code it accordingly to the mockup image given to myself. The final product looked really good and almost like the mockup image. 

I spent time firstly commenting out the code that I would be able to clean up both in the html and the css. I sectioned it out, with the header and the footer first, but basically i cleaned the code up by alot in the final product.

This project is designed accordingly to the user story.
